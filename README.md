ðŸ“š Quantum Bookstore
A fully extensible object-oriented Java application that simulates an online bookstore.
Built for the Fawry NÂ² Dev Slope #10 Challenge, this project handles different types of books and operations such as adding, buying, and removing outdated inventory â€” all designed with clean code principles.

ðŸ§© Core Concepts
Abstract Design: A base Book class with shared attributes and behavior

Interfaces for Extensibility: Buyable to define purchasing behavior

Specialized Subclasses:

ðŸ“• PaperBook â€” stock-based and delivered via shipping

ðŸ“˜ EBook â€” sent via email with a defined file type

ðŸ“™ ShowcaseBook â€” for display/demo only, not for sale

| ðŸ›’ Buy Book                    | Buy by ISBN, email, and address (with stock check and delivery simulation) |
| ðŸ”„ Remove Outdated Books       | Automatically remove books older than N years                              |
| ðŸ“¨ Email & Shipping Simulation | Static `MailService` and `ShippingService` print delivery confirmations    |
| ðŸ§ª Built-in Test Suite         | Includes a complete test class simulating all core use cases               |

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Designed to allow easy extension (e.g., adding AudioBooks) without modifying core logic.
